# GOhiring Data Team Code Challenge - Results

My GoHiring Code Challenge submission! This repository contains essential artifacts and scripts to address the challenge. Here's a brief overview:

### 📁 Data Folder
Explore critical data files:
- companies.json 🏢
- jobs.json 💼
- locations.csv 🌎

### 🐍 Python Scripts
Meet the main scripts:
- data_analysis.py 📊
- dimensional_model.py 🚀

### 📚 Jupyter Notebooks
Detailed notebooks:
- data_analysis.ipynb 🧠
- dimensional_model.ipynb 🌌

### 🗃️ SQL Queries
Structured queries:
- sql_queries.sql 🔮

### Breakdown of Scripts and Notebooks

🤖 **Code Correspondence:** Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks share common ground. Your choice—read as you like!

🔍 **Data Analysis:** Addresses questions 1 to 3, providing detailed insights. It encompasses data frame manipulations and analysis.

🌐 **Dimensional Modeling:** Tackles question 4 using SQLite. Also includes preliminary data visualization attempts (question 7).

📜 **Structured Solutions:** sql_queries.sql contains explicit responses to questions 5 and 6.

📊 **Visualization Insights:** Explore the Power BI report in .pbix format and a PDF snapshot. This visualization utilizes jobs.json and companies.json for evaluation. You will also added a demo recording showing the power bi report, and if there are any troubles with this recording, you will also fin it [here](https://clipchamp.com/watch/m2Zm0u413Fv). 

Feel free to delve into the code and documentation at your convenience. I look forward to discussing the details with you!
